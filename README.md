# Base Number Converter

## Author: Katrina Hill

## Description
The Base Number Converter is a Python program that allows users to convert numbers between various bases, specifically binary (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16). The program prompts the user for a number and its base, then converts it to a specified target base.

## Features
- Convert numbers between base 2, base 8, base 10, and base 16.
- Handles error cases for invalid inputs.
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure the accuracy of conversions.

## Files
- `num_Converter.py`: The main program that performs the base conversions.
- `test_cases.py`: A suite of tests for validating the functionality of the base conversion logic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
